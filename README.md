## Description

Palo Alto's GlobalProtect portal, a feature of PAN-OS, has been the subject of 
[several critical-severity vulnerabilities](https://security.paloaltonetworks.com/?severity=CRITICAL&product=PAN-OS&sort=-date) that can allow authorization bypass, unauthenticated remote code execution, etc. From an external perspective, it can be difficult to tell if you're running a patched version of PAN-OS since the GlobalProtect portal and management interface don't explicitly reveal their underlying software version.

To assist PAN-OS users in patching their firewalls, this scanner examines the `Last-Modified` and `ETag` HTTP response headers for several static web resources, and associates those values with specific PAN-OS releases. For example, note the `ETag` in the following HTTP response from the GlobalProtect portal login page:

```
$ curl -skI https://example.com/global-protect/login.esp
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: text/html; charset=UTF-8
Connection: keep-alive
ETag: "6e185d5daf9a"
```

Examining the last 8 characters of the `ETag` gives us the hexadecimal epoch time `5d5daf9a`, represented as `1566420890` in decimal format. We can convert this epoch time to a human-readable format using the UNIX `date` utility:

```
$ date -d @1566420890
Wed 21 Aug 2019 08:54:50 PM UTC
```

Using the attached `version-table.txt`, we can determine that this instance of GlobalProtect portal is running on PAN-OS version `8.1.10`, and is therefore vulnerable to 
[CVE-2020-2034](https://security.paloaltonetworks.com/CVE-2020-2034), an OS command injection vulnerability in GlobalProtect portal, and should consequently be patched.

```
$ awk '/Aug.*21.*2019/ {print $1}' version-table.txt 
8.1.10
```

This scanner automates the process described above, suggesting an exact (or approximate) underlying PAN-OS version for a remote GlobalProtect portal or management interface. When multiple versions are associated with a given date, this tool will display all version matches as a comma-separated list; e.g, `7.1.24-h1,8.0.19-h1,8.1.9-h4` for `2019-08-15`.

## Getting started

### Install

```
$ git clone https://github.com/noperator/panos-scanner.git
```

### Usage

Note that this script requires `version-table.txt` in the same directory.

```
$ python3 panos-scanner.py -h
usage: Determine the software version of a remote PAN-OS target. Requires version-table.txt in the same directory.
       [-h] [-v] [-s] -t TARGET

optional arguments:
  -h, --help  show this help message and exit
  -v          verbose output
  -s          stop after one exact match
  -t TARGET   https://example.com
```

In the following example, `https://example.com/global-protect/portal/images/favicon.ico` has an HTTP response header that indicates that it's running PAN-OS version `8.0.10`.

```
$ python3 panos-scanner.py -t https://example.com
8.0.10 2018-05-04 (exact)
```

Also supports verbose output.

```
$ python3 panos-scanner.py -v -t https://example.com
[*] https://example.com
[+] global-protect/login.esp
[*] 2018-05-03 ~ 2018-05-04 => 8.0.10
[-] php/login.php (ReadTimeout)
[+] global-protect/portal/css/login.css
[*] 2018-05-03 ~ 2018-05-04 => 8.0.10
[*] 2018-05-04 => 8.0.10
[-] js/Pan.js (HTTPError)
[+] global-protect/portal/images/favicon.ico
[*] 2018-05-04 => 8.0.10
[-] login/images/favicon.ico (HTTPError)
[+] global-protect/portal/images/logo-pan-48525a.svg
[*] 2018-05-04 => 8.0.10
8.0.10 2018-05-04 (exact)
```

This tool doesn't currently support reading from a list of targets. Instead, here's a useful way to test multiple targets using a Bash `for` loop, along with the `tr` and `column` utilities. You can equivalently use a Bash `while` loop over the contents of a text file: `$ cat target_list.txt | while read TARGET; do ...`.

```
$ for TARGET in \
https://example.com \
https://nomatchexample.com \
https://doublematchexample.com \
http://nonexistentexample.com \
; do
    echo -n "$TARGET;"
    python3 panos-scanner.py -s -t "$TARGET" | tr '\n' ';'
    echo
done | column -t -s ';'

https://example.com             8.1.9 2019-07-03 (exact)
https://nomatchexample.com      no matches found
https://doublematchexample.com  8.1.12 2019-12-10 (exact)  9.1.0 2019-12-11 (approximate)
http://nonexistentexample.com   ConnectionError
```
